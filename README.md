# DataOps

This project involves building a script/CLI that performs operations on a dataset containing information about individuals, including their first name, telephone number, email, password, role, date of account creation, and a list of children with their names and ages. The dataset is distributed across multiple files in JSON, XML, and CSV formats.

## Tasks
1. **Login Functionality:**
Users can log in using the --login and --password options, with the ability to use either their email or a 9-digit phone number.
2. **User and Admin Commands:**
The script allows both regular users and administrators to execute various commands. Admins have access to base user commands as well as additional commands reserved for admin users.
