# DataOps

This project involves building a script/CLI that performs operations on a dataset containing information about individuals, including their first name, telephone number, email, password, role, date of account creation, and a list of children with their names and ages. The dataset is distributed across multiple files in JSON, XML, and CSV formats.

## Tasks
- Login with `--login` and `--password` (email or 9-digit phone).
- Admins can perform base user commands.
